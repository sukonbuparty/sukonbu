Hello, this is going to be a short explanation on what has been going on in this past three months.

TL;DR: my PC broke down and I was refused a replacement; I've just got it back and it's still broken, so it will be sent again for repairs.

The long explanation is that when I sent my PC for repairs after a fan issue, I was refused service because my warranty was over. I've checked this, and my warranty should still be on for about 6 more months. After going back and forth with the OEM, we found out that the computer I was using was actually a refurbished product sold to me without my knowledge, and it had 4 service records before it finally reached my hands. The issue is that neither the selling company nor the third-party website I bought this from acknowledges this. The third-party website tells me to solve it between the seller company and the seller company outright refuses replacement and told me they could only do repairs on it. After waiting for around three months, I've finally got the supposedly repaired computer with the aluminum fan air holes visibly distorted, causing noise when pressed on, and the fan issues not actually being fixed.

This is quite the predicament, so we'll see how this goes. I'm still around, but since I don't have another computer, the blog may see fewer updates.

Thank you for your support in this time.
