If you were wondering how I decide on my posts, here's how:

### 1# Finding an interesting topic

This can be anything that I feel is interesting, or something I like, there can be all sorts of things like talking about how Kotlin sucks, Youtuber drama or game reviews. 

### 2# Creating the posts

Thanks to the blong software I use, making a new post is quite easy, I'll use the ```hugo new``` command to create a new markdown document and fill it up with the stuff I want to talk about. I try my best to remain neutral when writing the post and convey as much information as possible to the reader so they can decide if the content's topic is good or bad based on their opinions (Except posts like Game reviews)

### 3# Seeing how it looks

I run a developer instance of Hugo on my local machine to see how my post looks when parsed, I do the required edits and add the required refferences then give it a last look, I may sometimes use an AI chatbot to do spellchecking for me (My editor does not do that for me, so I'm hoping you can cut me some slack on that regard :pray:)

### 4# Publishing the article

I disable the draft toggle to show that the post is ready for publishing. I sign my commit and send it for it to get parsed once again by actions. After that's done, the post is up for everyone to see.

If you have any questions regarding this process, please let me know by sending an email.
