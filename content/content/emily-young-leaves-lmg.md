On January 28 2025, [Emily Young](https://www.youtube.com/@emily-young) posted a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ELnX3gEHuHI) on her channel titled "I Left Linus Media Group - What Do I Do Now?"

Emily Young was a former writer and host at [Linus Media Group (LMG)](https://linusmediagroup.com/), the parent company of many well-known channels such as Linus Tech Tips, TechLinked and ShortCircuit. Many of the fans known her from his appearence and knowledge on Linux related content.

On May 27 2023, Emily Young had announced she was [coming out as transgender](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b-owBhLGaH4) with a video on [her personal Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@emily-young). Following this announcement though, her appearence on videos have dropped significantly and they have been continuing their work as a writer.

Linus Media Group has been called out in the past for mistreatment and poor work conditions. One female ex-employee of LMG had alleged that she has been inappropriately grabbed multiple times by employees in the office. She also stated that she was barred from appearing on videos due to her gender. These allegations caused LMG to halt production and hire a private investigator. LMG has announced that following a third-party investigation conducted by Vancouver-based law firm Roper Greyell, that the claims of alleged workplace bullying and sexual harassment “were not substantiated”.

From the contents of the video, and the comment left on it by Linus Media Group's founder Linus Sebastian, this appears to be a choice made by Emily Young, and is unrelated to the drama that have been surrounding LMG.

In the video, Emily Young talks about multiple topics including future plans of the channel, monetization startegy and talks about how she is not an expert, just a curious person on topics others had assumed she was.
