[CrazyRussianHacker (CRH)](https://www.youtube.com/@CrazyRussianHacker) is a Youtube channel ran by Taras Kulakov, who is known by their catchphrase "Safety is [the] number one priority"

During 2013 his channel has grown in popularity due to his experiments, life hacks and military MRE reviews which he posted in his Youtube channel.

After a while his channel has turned it's focus to low effort videos such as gadget and monthly crate reviews. It's assumed that the reason why this happened was due to him getting married with his wife, Katherine Kulakova, and having to allocate time in order to look after their newborn children.

Taras has released a new video on their channel which goes on to explain the new changes to the channel, his new studio and it ends with him dropping dry ice into his frozen pool.

The year 2024 has caused a few notable Youtubers to leave or pause new content creation on the platform including MatPat (aka. Matthew Robert Patrick of [Game Theory](https://www.youtube.com/@GameTheory)) announcing that they will be retiring, Science Youtuber [Tom Scott](https://www.youtube.com/@TomScottGo) announcing they will be pausing weekly uploads after 10 years and a notable amount of popular Virtual Youtubers announcing their graduations.
