Iskall85 shared a video on his channel titled "I got cancelled" where he talks about what has been going on during the time which he was inactive.

Iskall85 is a Swedish Minecraft Youtuber, and was one of the members of Hermitcraft SMP. On November 23 2024 there has been a post on the Hermitcraft Twitter account which contained the following image:

The responses and actions of other members have left more questions than answers. For example, Hermitcraft SMP member [Grian](https://www.youtube.com/@Grian) removed any appearence of Iskall85 from his video thumbnails and [Mumbo Jumbo](https://www.youtube.com/@ThatMumboJumbo) removed some items from his merch store that referenced Iskall85.

In the video, Iskall85 claims that the allegations were released to the Hermitcraft Discord server by another member and that he was given only 1.5 hours to respond. At the time, Iskall85 says that the Swedish police were already handling the situation and that he was told not to answer anyone about the allegations which he complied, resuting in him getting removed from the SMP together with another member, [Stressmonster101](https://www.youtube.com/@Stressmonster101).

Before this video was released, other videos about this topic had been released, such as [The Unexpected Downfall of Iskall85](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oim_qQydDJs) by Parallax

So far there hasn't been any response from any other Hermitcraft SMP members including [xisumavoid](https://www.youtube.com/@xisumavoid) who is the leader of Hermitcraft SMP.
